to
be
or
not
to
be
that
is
the
question
whether
tis
nobler
in
the
mind
to
suffer
the
slings
and
arrows
of
outrageous
fortune
or
to
take
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
and
by
opposing
end
them
to
die
to
sleep
no
more
and
by
a
sleep
to
say
we
end
the
heartache
and
the
thousand
natural
shocks
that
flesh
is
heir
to
tis
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wishd
to
die
to
sleep
to
sleep
perchance
to
dream
ay
theres
the
rub
for
in
that
sleep
of
death
what
dreams
may
come
when
we
have
shuffled
off
this
mortal
coil
must
give
us
pause
theres
the
respect
that
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
for
who
would
bear
the
whips
and
scorns
of
time
the
oppressors
wrong
the
proud
mans
contumely
the
pangs
of
despised
love
the
laws
delay
the
insolence
of
office
and
the
spurns
that
patient
merit
of
the
unworthy
takes
when
he
himself
might
his
quietus
make
with
a
bare
bodkin
who
would
fardels
bear
to
grunt
and
sweat
under
a
weary
life
but
that
the
dread
of
something
after
death
the
undiscoverd
country
from
whose
bourn
no
traveller
returns
puzzles
the
will
and
makes
us
rather
bear
those
ills
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
thus
conscience
does
make
cowards
of
us
all
and
thus
the
native
hue
of
resolution
is
sicklied
oer
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
and
enterprises
of
great
pith
and
moment
with
this
regard
their
currents
turn
awry
and
lose
the
name
of
